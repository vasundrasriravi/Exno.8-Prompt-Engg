# Aim: 
To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio Generation.

# Algorithm: 
1. Identify the type of audio content required (music, effects, voice narration).
2. Choose a suitable prompting technique such as zero-shot, few-shot, role-based, or chain-of-thought.
3. Design precise and descriptive prompts tailored to the specific audio goal.
4. Select and apply appropriate AI tools/models for audio generation.
5. Evaluate and refine the generated audio based on quality, clarity, and relevance to the use case.

# AI Tools Required:
1. For Assistance: ChatGPT, DeepSeek
2. For Audio Generation: ElevenLabs, Google TTS, Riffusion, Bark

# Prompt Examples:
1. Generate an upbeat jazz melody suitable for a morning podcast intro. It should be energetic, loopable, and 20–30 seconds long.
2. Example 1: “Welcome to our show” (excited tone). Now say: “Get ready to explore new ideas.”
3. Create a suspenseful sound design: start with a soft heartbeat rhythm, build tension using strings, and end with a sudden bass hit.
4. You are a meditation guide. Generate a soft, slow-paced voiceover saying: “Breathe in… and relax.”

# Procedure:
1. Define Application Needs – Identify specific use cases (e.g., podcast intro music, guided meditation voice, thriller sound effects).
2. Design Prompts – Construct clear and effective prompts using various prompting techniques.
3. Model Selection – Choose relevant AI models such as ElevenLabs (voice), Bark (sound), and Riffusion (music).
4. Prompt Execution – Run the prompts in selected tools and generate the audio content.
5. Iterate – Refine the prompts if needed to improve quality, tone, or style of the output.

# Output:
1. Calm rainy ambient music with soft piano, slow tempo, and peaceful mood for relaxation.
